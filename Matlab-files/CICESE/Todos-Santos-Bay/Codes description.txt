'anom_var.m': function that makes anomalies calculations based on observed value and the average.

'bts_ext_var_interp.m': Makes interpolation matrices of hydrographic variables of BTS's campaigns of its external region.

'bts_int_var_graf.m': Load interpolation matrices of hydrographic variables of BTS's campaigns on its interior region. Makes temperature/salinity diagrams, transverse  sections and horizontal fields.

'graficas_bts.m': 'In situ' data graphics for BTS cruises for each sample line.

'graficas_lance.m': Profiles graphics of hydrographic variables of each cast for each cruise line.

'graficas_lineas.m': Sample lines graphic for a specific cruise campaign: BTS*

'lector_ctd_files.m': Load CTD data from BTS cruises, and find flag values.

'mapasBTSpresion.m': Makes objective mapping (analysis) graphs of hydrographic variables. Load data from 'datosBTS*' files.

'promedios_lineas_ext.m': Makes spacial/time averages/anomalies calculations on sample lines for BTS's cruises.

'stats_basic.m': function that calculates mean and standard deviation of variables.

'lineamax.mx': Load data files and calculate the maximum distance of the sample lines in each cruise. Also, calculates the min and max value for each variable.

'season_var_bts_ext.m': Ploted variables by seasons in BTS exterior. Allows to make observations of errors.

'comp_var_esovsteos.m': Compares between values of variables calculated with EOS-80 and TEOS-10 state equations.)

'reshape_time_hobo.m': Reshapes time data of tides files of HOBO instrument anchorage in Rincon de Ballenas Bay.
