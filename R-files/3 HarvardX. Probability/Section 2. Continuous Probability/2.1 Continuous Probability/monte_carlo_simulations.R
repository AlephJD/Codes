## Code: Monte Carlo simulation of tallest person over 7 feet
B <- 10000
tallest <- replicate(B, {
  simulated_data <- rnorm(800, avg, s)    # generate 800 normally distributed random heights
  max(simulated_data)    # determine the tallest height
})
mean(tallest >= 7*12)    # proportion of times that tallest person exceeded 7 feet (84 inches)
